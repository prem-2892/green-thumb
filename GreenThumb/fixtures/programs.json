Participants have choice and flexibility in implementing capital and non-capital energy-efficiency measures, and are rewarded for energy savings and peak demand savings at the same incentive rate regardless of the types of projects/activities that have been implemented. Participants receive a performance incentive based on electricity savings determined by comparing metered consumption to their baseline energy model. Participants receive $0.04/kWh multiplied by the electricity savings realized with the annual incentive capped at 20 percent of the facility baseline energy use. Participants are also eligible to receive a performance incentive based on summer peak demand savings determined by comparing metered consumption to their baseline energy model. Participants receive $50/kW multiplied by the summer peak demand savings realized with the annual incentive capped at 20 percent of the facility baseline summer peak demand."
